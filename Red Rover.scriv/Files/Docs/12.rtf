\f0\fs26 \cf0 David's dead but not gone. Having access to Janet's synaptic scanner, he made a backup of himself just before he and Janet went over to debrief Valkyrie. He sent his backup to Earth, where it was restored into...something. Perhaps another ship? Now David is the ACU of an Earth military ship that's been sent out to hunt down Janet and Rover... Nice idea.  Especially when we can throw *two* antagonists into the plot now (Earth and Lysithia).  David could be the more tangible, present enemy, while Lysithians are the omnipresent background threat we're trying to avoid attention from.  -Ben Collins-Sussman 10/14/09 10:59 AM  }
